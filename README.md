# Face Recognition with Eigen and Fisher Face Algorithms
Face recognition by using Eigen and Fisher Face Algorithms.
The first Recognition algorithm implemented is Eigen Face. We collected the dataset and
preprocessed the data we collected. The pictures were cropped and resized appropriately so
they can be fed to the algorithm. We partitioned our data to train and test sets. Then we
flattened our training images and stacked them in a vector. We found the mean of our data.
